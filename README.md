üéØ Problem Statement

Learning Salesforce Apex and automation effectively can be challenging without practical examples. Key challenges include:

Understanding triggers, batch jobs, scheduled jobs, and asynchronous processing.

Combining declarative automation (Flows, Process Builder) with Apex.

Creating dynamic Lightning Web Components (LWC) for interactive dashboards.

Writing proper unit tests and ensuring 100% code coverage for deployment readiness.

Salesforce ApexHub provides ready-to-use Apex recipes and best-practice examples to address these challenges.


‚ú® Key Features & Solution

| Feature / Recipe            | Implementation                                                                 | Learning / Business Value                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger Recipes**         | `AccountTrigger`, `OpportunityTrigger`                                         | Automates updates and notifications on record changes         |
| **Batch & Scheduled Apex**  | `BatchUpdateContacts`, `ScheduledReportEmail`                                  | Handles large data volumes and scheduled operations           |
| **Future & Queueable Apex** | `AsyncEmailSender`                                                             | Executes asynchronous, non-blocking processes                 |
| **Custom LWC Components**   | `OpportunityDashboardLWC`, `ContactChartLWC`                                   | Builds interactive, dynamic Salesforce dashboards             |
| **Declarative Automation**  | Flows for Lead Assignment & Opportunity Stage Updates                          | Demonstrates combining declarative and programmatic solutions |
| **Mock API Integrations**   | REST callouts to external services (`WeatherService`, rebate calculators)      | Simulates integration scenarios                               |
| **Unit Tests & Coverage**   | Test classes for all recipes (`AccountTriggerTest`, `BatchUpdateContactsTest`) | Ensures deployment readiness and best practices               |


Architecture & Data Model

The solution is built on a custom data model for Apex recipes and execution logs:

Custom Objects: Recipe__c (metadata), RecipeLog__c (execution history)

Standard Objects: Account, Contact, Opportunity

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

Automation: Flow Builder, Apex Triggers, Batch, Scheduled, Queueable, and Future methods.

User Interface: Interactive dashboards built using Lightning Web Components (LWC).

Integration: Mock REST API callouts from Apex for external service interactions.

Event-Driven Architecture: Platform Events for decoupled processes and notifications.

DevOps: Salesforce DX, Git/GitHub for source-driven development and version control.
