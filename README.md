ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Learning Salesforce Apex and automation effectively can be challenging without practical examples. Key challenges include:

Understanding triggers, batch jobs, scheduled jobs, and asynchronous processing.

Combining declarative automation (Flows, Process Builder) with Apex.

Creating dynamic Lightning Web Components (LWC) for interactive dashboards.

Writing proper unit tests and ensuring 100% code coverage for deployment readiness.

Salesforce ApexHub provides ready-to-use Apex recipes and best-practice examples to address these challenges.
